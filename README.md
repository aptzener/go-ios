# Go-iOS
Welcome ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this project is to provide a stable and production ready opensource solution to automate iOS device on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. I am delighted to announce that a few companies including [headspin.io](https://www.headspin.io/) will use or are using go-iOS. 
If you are interested in controlling iOS devices, please also check out https://github.com/nanoscopic/controlfloor written by my good friend @nanoscopic 

Follow my twitter for updates or check out my medium blog: https://daniel-paulus.medium.com/

If you are interested in using go-iOS please get in touch on LinkedIn, Twitter or the Github discussions above, I always love to hear what people are doing with it. 

If you miss something your Mac can do but go-iOS can't, just request a feature in the issues tab.

# Design principles:
1. Using golang to compile static, small and fast binaries for all platforms very easily. 
   
   *Build Manual*: Install golang and run `go build`
2. All output as JSON so you can easily use go-iOS form any other programming language
3. Everything is a module, you can use go-iOS in golang projects as a module dependency easily

# Features:
 Most notable:
 - Install apps zipped as ipa or unzipped from their .app folder `ios install --path=/path/to/app`
 - Run XCTests including WebdriverAgent on Linux, Windows and Mac
 - Start and Stop apps
 - Use a debug proxy to reverse engineer every tool Mac OSX has, so you can contrib to go-ios or build      your own
 - Pair devices without manual tapping on a popup
 - Install developer images automatically by running `ios image auto`
 - Set thermal states and network emulation on the device with the `ios devicestate` command

All features:
